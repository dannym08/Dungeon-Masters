## About Dungeon-Masters
Have you ever wanted to be the best stealth dungeon master without knowing the rules? Learn with our own agents as we take on the dungeon master puzzles and learn which spaces we need to avoid to grab the diamond treasure!

Our goal in this project is to create an agent that will train to solve a dungeon. These dungeons will be represented by rooms, which will be basic at first, with an exit and entrance.
